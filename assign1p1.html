		  <h4>Short Summary of Steve Harrington from Stanger Things</h4>
		  <p>Steve Harington is a dude from Stanger Things who has a lot of hair. He's dating that one kid's older sister I think. He may or may not be a lifeguard;
			  I haven't seen the show in a nwhile. He was a bad guy but then became a good guy. He's played by Joe something who has became a fan favorite since the 
			  show premiered. Steve will surely be back in the next season to fight more monsters.
